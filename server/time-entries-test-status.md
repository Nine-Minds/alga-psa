# Time Entries E2E Test Status

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: 39
- **Passing**: 31
- **Failing**: 8

## Fixed Issues

### Permission Tests (4/4 passing)
The permission tests were failing because they were creating API keys for users that already had all permissions. Fixed by creating new users without any roles/permissions before creating the API keys.

Fixed tests:
- ✅ should enforce read permissions for listing
- ✅ should enforce create permissions
- ✅ should enforce update permissions
- ✅ should enforce delete permissions

## Remaining Failures

### 1. List filtering tests (3 failures)
- **should filter by date range**: Expected 2 entries but got 3
- **should filter by user**: Expected 1 entry but got 2  
- **should filter by billable status**: Some entries not matching the billable filter

These appear to be test data isolation issues where entries from other tests are interfering.

### 2. Approval tests (2 failures)
- **should approve time entries**: Getting 403 Forbidden - missing 'approve' permission
- **should reject invalid entry IDs for approval**: Getting 403 instead of 400

The test user doesn't have the 'approve' permission (only CRUD permissions are set up).

### 3. Export test (1 failure)
- **should export time entries to CSV**: Headers not being set correctly

### 4. Templates test (1 failure)  
- **should list time entry templates**: Database table "time_entry_templates" doesn't exist

### 5. Error handling test (1 failure)
- **should handle invalid date format**: Expected 400 but got 200 (validation not working for date format)

## Next Steps
1. Add 'approve' permission to the test setup
2. Create the missing time_entry_templates table
3. Fix date validation in the API
4. Improve test data isolation for filtering tests
5. Fix CSV export headers
