This is a simulated large file for testing file size validation.

${"Large content padding: " + "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. ".repeat(1000)}

This file is used to test:
- Maximum file size limits
- Upload timeout handling
- Storage capacity checks
- Error messaging for oversized files

The repeated content simulates a large file without actually creating a huge test fixture.
