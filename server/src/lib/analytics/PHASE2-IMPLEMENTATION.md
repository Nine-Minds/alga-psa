# Phase 2: Usage Analytics Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Ticket Operations Analytics ✅
- **Ticket Creation**: Tracks ticket type, priority, categories, assignment status, creation method (manual vs from asset)
- **Ticket Updates**: Tracks fields updated, status changes, assignments, and resolution time
- **Ticket Resolution**: Tracks time to resolution, priority, category, and assignment status
- **Ticket Assignment**: Tracks reassignments and time to first assignment
- **Ticket Deletion**: Tracks age of ticket and resolution status
- **Ticket Search**: Tracks search queries, filters used, result counts
- **Ticket Comments**: Tracks internal vs external comments, resolution comments

### 2. Authentication Analytics ✅
- **Login Success**: Tracks provider (Google, credentials, Keycloak), user type, 2FA status
- **Login Failures**: Tracks failure reasons (inactive account, invalid password)
- **User Registration**: Tracks registration method, user type, company creation
- **User Logout**: Tracks user type on logout
- **OAuth Failures**: Tracks Google OAuth failures for inactive accounts

### 3. Search Functionality Analytics ✅
- **Ticket Search**: Query length, search fields, filters applied, result count
- **Search Performance**: Integrated into TicketService

### 4. API Performance Tracking ✅
- **Analytics Middleware**: Created middleware to track API request performance
- **Slow Query Detection**: Flags requests over 1s, tracks separately if over 2s
- **Error Tracking**: Captures API errors with endpoint and error type
- **Performance Decorator**: For tracking slow operations in services

## Analytics Events Implemented

### Ticket Events
- `ticket_created` - When a new ticket is created
- `ticket_updated` - When ticket fields are modified
- `ticket_resolved` - When ticket status changes to closed
- `ticket_assigned` - When ticket is assigned or reassigned
- `ticket_deleted` - When a ticket is deleted
- `ticket_searched` - When tickets are searched
- `ticket_comment_added` - When comments are added

### Authentication Events
- `user_logged_in` - Successful login
- `user_logged_out` - User logout
- `user_signed_up` - New user registration
- `login_failed` - Failed login attempts
- `auth_validated` - Successful credential validation

### Performance Events
- `api_request` - All API requests with duration
- `slow_query` - Queries exceeding 2s threshold
- `api_error` - API request failures
- `slow_operation` - Service operations over 500ms
- `operation_error` - Service operation failures

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Privacy-First Approach**
   - No PII in events
   - Anonymized IDs for on-premise
   - Aggressive sanitization

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Request duration tracking
   - Slow query detection
   - Error rate monitoring

3. **User Journey Tracking**
   - Login methods and providers
   - Feature usage patterns
   - Error recovery paths

4. **Deployment-Aware**
   - Different data collection for hosted vs on-premise
   - Respects ALGA_USAGE_STATS environment variable

## Next Steps

### Remaining Phase 2 Tasks:
1. **Time Tracking Analytics** - Track time entry creation, updates, timesheet submissions
2. **Billing Operations** - Track invoice generation, payment processing, billing rules
3. **Testing** - Verify all analytics events are firing correctly
4. **Documentation** - Complete analytics event reference

### Phase 3 Preview:
- User cohorts and segmentation
- Conversion funnels
- A/B testing framework
- Advanced dashboards in PostHog

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Ticket creation with analytics
analytics.capture(AnalyticsEvents.TICKET_CREATED, {
  ticket_type: 'manual',
  priority_id: ticket.priority_id,
  has_description: true,
  created_via: 'web_app'
}, userId);

// API performance tracking
@trackPerformance('search_tickets')
async search(data: SearchData) {
  // Method implementation
}

// Login tracking
analytics.capture(AnalyticsEvents.USER_LOGGED_IN, {
  provider: 'google',
  user_type: 'msp',
  has_two_factor: true
}, userId);
```

## Testing Analytics

To test the implementation:
1. Set `ALGA_USAGE_STATS=true` in your environment
2. Perform actions (create tickets, login, search)
3. Check PostHog dashboard for events
4. Verify no PII is being sent
5. Test opt-out with `ALGA_USAGE_STATS=false`
