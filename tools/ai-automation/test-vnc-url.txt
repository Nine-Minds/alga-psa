Based on your successful test-ws.html results, try these exact URLs in your browser:

1. Most likely to work (empty path parameter):
   http://localhost:30003/vnc/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&host=localhost&port=30003&path=&encrypt=false

2. VNC Lite version (simpler):
   http://localhost:30003/vnc/vnc_lite.html?host=localhost&port=30003&path=&encrypt=false

3. Let NoVNC figure it out:
   http://localhost:30003/vnc/vnc.html?autoconnect=true&encrypt=false

The critical part is: path=
(empty path parameter, not missing - actually present but empty)

If these don't work, open the browser console (F12) and look for WebSocket errors.
The error will tell us exactly what URL NoVNC is trying to connect to.
