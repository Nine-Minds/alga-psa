# Service Type Management Refactor Summary

## Overview
Removed standalone Service Types settings page and integrated service type management directly into the Service Catalog form with inline editing capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: EditableServiceTypeSelect
**File:** `server/src/components/ui/EditableServiceTypeSelect.tsx`

A new dropdown component that provides inline CRUD operations for service types:
- **View Mode:** Displays service types in a standard dropdown
- **Edit Mode:** Click pencil icon → edit service type name inline
- **Delete Mode:** Click trash icon → delete service type (with usage check)
- **Add Mode:** Click plus button → add new service type inline
- **Keyboard Support:**
  - Enter key to save
  - Escape key to cancel
- **Icons Used:** Pencil, Trash2, Plus, Check, X (from lucide-react)

### 2. New Service Actions
**File:** `server/src/lib/actions/serviceActions.ts`

Added three new inline management functions:

```typescript
createServiceTypeInline(name: string): Promise<IServiceType>
```
- Creates new service type with just a name
- Auto-assigns `billing_method` as 'per_unit'
- Auto-calculates next `order_number`

```typescript
updateServiceTypeInline(id: string, name: string): Promise<IServiceType>
```
- Updates service type name only
- Simplified version of `updateServiceType`

```typescript
deleteServiceTypeInline(id: string): Promise<void>
```
- Alias for existing `deleteServiceType`
- Includes usage validation (prevents deletion if service type is in use)

### 3. Updated QuickAddService Component
**File:** `server/src/components/settings/billing/QuickAddService.tsx`

Changes:
- Replaced `SearchableSelect` with `EditableServiceTypeSelect`
- Added `onServiceTypesChange` prop to refresh service types after CRUD operations
- Integrated inline CRUD callbacks:
  - `onCreateType` → calls `createServiceTypeInline`
  - `onUpdateType` → calls `updateServiceTypeInline`
  - `onDeleteType` → calls `deleteServiceTypeInline`

### 4. Updated ServiceCatalogManager Component
**File:** `server/src/components/settings/billing/ServiceCatalogManager.tsx`

Changes:
- Replaced `CustomSelect` with `EditableServiceTypeSelect` in edit dialog
- Added inline CRUD callbacks (same as QuickAddService)
- Updated `QuickAddService` call to pass `onServiceTypesChange={fetchAllServiceTypes}`

### 5. Simplified BillingSettings Component
**File:** `server/src/components/settings/billing/BillingSettings.tsx`

Changes:
- Removed "Service Types" tab entirely
- Removed tab structure (CustomTabs)
- Removed imports: `ServiceTypeSettings`, `ServiceCategoriesSettings`, `CustomTabs`
- Now displays invoice settings directly (no tabs needed)

### 6. Archived Component
**File:** `server/src/components/settings/billing/ServiceTypeSettings.tsx`

Status: **No longer used** (can be removed or archived)
- This component provided the standalone Service Types management page
- All functionality now integrated into service catalog forms

## Database Schema
**No changes required** - existing schema remains intact:
- `standard_service_types` table (global reference, 12 predefined types)
- `service_types` table (tenant-specific custom types)
- `service_catalog` table (links to `service_types` via `custom_service_type_id`)

## User Experience Changes

### Before:
1. Navigate to Settings > Billing > Service Types tab
2. Manage service types in a separate table view
3. Navigate to Service Catalog to use service types
4. Service type dropdown was read-only

### After:
1. Navigate directly to Service Catalog
2. Service type dropdown has inline management:
   - **Select** existing type
   - **Edit** type name (pencil icon)
   - **Delete** type (trash icon, with usage validation)
   - **Add** new type (plus button at bottom)
3. All changes immediately available in the dropdown
4. No need to navigate to separate settings page

## Benefits
✅ Streamlined workflow - manage types where you use them
✅ Fewer clicks and page navigations
✅ Immediate feedback when creating/editing types
✅ Consistent experience across Add and Edit service dialogs
✅ Standard service types pre-populated for all tenants
✅ Usage validation prevents accidental deletions

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open Service Catalog (Add Service dialog)
- [ ] Verify standard service types appear in dropdown
- [ ] Create new custom service type via plus button
- [ ] Edit custom service type name via pencil icon
- [ ] Delete unused custom service type via trash icon
- [ ] Verify cannot delete service type that's in use
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
- [ ] Open Edit Service dialog and verify same functionality
- [ ] Verify Settings > Billing no longer has Service Types tab
- [ ] Verify invoice settings still accessible in Settings > Billing

## Migration Notes
No database migration needed. Existing service types and their relationships remain unchanged.

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for later:
- Bulk service type management UI (if needed)
- Service type reordering via drag-and-drop
- Service type usage statistics in dropdown
- Billing method selection during inline creation
