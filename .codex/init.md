You *MUST* start by doing the following:

- Go to the ~/.codex/skills folder
- For each subfolder, open it up and use yq, aw/sed etc to efficiently read the frontmatter info
- Efficiently incorporate the given skills at appropriate times when the user is mentioning relevant topics

Answer back to the user and give them a summary of the skills you have acquired.
