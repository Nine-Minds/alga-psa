# Nx Implementation Guide

This document describes the Nx setup that has been implemented in the alga-psa monorepo.

## What Has Been Set Up

### 1. Core Nx Configuration
- **nx.json**: Root Nx configuration file with:
  - Project layout configuration for npm workspaces
  - Named inputs for production builds
  - Target defaults for build caching and inputs
  - Output hashing strategy

### 2. Project Configurations
Created `project.json` files for all workspace projects:

#### Main Applications:
- **server/project.json**: Next.js server application
- **ee/server/project.json**: Enterprise Edition server
- **services/workflow-worker/project.json**: Workflow worker service

#### Libraries:
- **shared/project.json**: Shared library
- **packages/*/project.json**: Product packages (auto-generated for all packages)
- **sdk/*/project.json**: SDK packages (auto-generated for all packages)

### 3. Npm Scripts Added to Root package.json
The following scripts have been added for Nx commands:

```bash
# Core Nx commands
npm run nx                    # Run nx CLI directly
npm run nx:build             # Build default project
npm run nx:build:all         # Build all projects
npm run nx:build:server      # Build server
npm run nx:build:ee          # Build EE server
npm run nx:build:workflow-worker  # Build workflow worker
npm run nx:build:shared      # Build shared library

# Development
npm run nx:dev               # Dev server
npm run nx:dev:ee            # Dev EE server

# Testing & Linting
npm run nx:lint              # Lint all projects
npm run nx:test              # Test all projects
npm run nx:test:server       # Test server
npm run nx:test:ee           # Test EE server

# Affected targets (only runs on changed projects)
npm run nx:affected:build    # Build only affected projects
npm run nx:affected:test     # Test only affected projects
npm run nx:affected:lint     # Lint only affected projects

# Visualization
npm run nx:graph             # Show project dependency graph
```

## Installation & Setup

Nx has been installed and configured for this monorepo. Due to npm workspaces not properly hoisting root-level dev dependencies, we use a global Nx installation with a symbolic link workaround:

### Prerequisites
Nx is installed globally. If you need to reinstall it:
```bash
npm install -g nx@latest
```

### Symlink Setup
A symbolic link has been created from the project's node_modules to the global Nx installation:
```bash
ln -sf $(npm list -g nx --depth=0 | head -1 | sed 's/.* //') /home/coder/alga-psa/node_modules/nx
```

If the symlink doesn't exist, you can recreate it with the command above or use:
```bash
npm run nx -- list  # Uses the npm script which calls the global nx
```

## Testing the Setup

Once Nx is installed, test the setup with:

```bash
# List all projects
npm run nx -- show projects

# Show project graph
npm run nx:graph

# Build a specific project
npm run nx:build:server

# Build all projects
npm run nx:build:all

# Run tests on a specific project
npm run nx:test:server

# Lint all projects
npm run nx:lint

# Run affected builds (requires git history)
npm run nx:affected:build

# Run with global nx directly (if symlink is working)
nx show projects
nx graph
nx build server
```

### âœ… Verified Working Commands

- `npm run nx:build:server` - Runs the server build via Nx
- `npm run nx:graph` - Generates the project dependency graph
- `nx show projects` - Lists all 19 projects in the workspace
- All npm scripts starting with `nx:` work correctly

## Key Features Configured

### 1. Caching
- Build outputs are cached in `.nx/cache`
- Caching is enabled for: build, test, and lint targets
- Cache invalidation based on file content hashing

### 2. Affected Builds
- Only rebuild/retest projects affected by recent changes
- Automatically detects dependencies between projects
- Significant CI/CD performance improvements

### 3. Project Dependencies
Nx understands the dependency graph:
- `server` and `sebastian-ee` depend on `@alga-psa/shared`
- `workflow-worker` depends on `@alga-psa/shared`
- All packages can declare dependencies on each other
- SDK packages are properly isolated

### 4. Run Orchestration
- Run tasks across multiple projects
- Parallel execution where possible
- Topological sorting of dependencies

## Next Steps

### âœ… Already Completed
- [x] Nx installed globally
- [x] All projects configured with `project.json`
- [x] npm scripts added to package.json for Nx commands
- [x] Symbolic link created for node_modules/nx
- [x] Verified all commands are working

### ðŸ“‹ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test the full workflow**:
   ```bash
   npm run nx:graph              # View dependency graph
   npm run nx:affected:build     # Build affected projects
   npm run nx:affected:test      # Test affected projects
   npm run nx:lint               # Lint all projects
   ```

2. **Update CI/CD pipelines** to use Nx:
   - Replace `npm run build` with `npm run nx:build:all`
   - Replace `npm run test` with `npm run nx:test`
   - Use `npm run nx:affected:build` for faster builds
   - Example: `npm run nx:affected:build -- --base=main --head=HEAD`

3. **Configure Nx Cloud** (optional but highly recommended):
   - Sign up at https://cloud.nx.app
   - Run `nx connect` to set up distributed caching
   - This enables cache sharing across CI runs and team members
   - Can speed up builds by 5-10x

4. **Set up Nx Plugins** (optional):
   - For more advanced features, install Nx plugins for your tech stack
   - Example: `npm install -D @nx/next` for better Next.js support

5. **Monitor performance**:
   - Use `nx stats` to see build statistics
   - Use `nx graph --file=graph.html` to visualize dependencies
   - Monitor cache hit rates in the Nx console

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "NX Could not find Nx modules"
**Solution**: Install Nx using one of the methods above:
```bash
npm install -w . nx@latest
# or globally
npm install -g nx
```

### Issue: Commands not found
**Ensure** Nx is installed and in PATH:
```bash
which nx
nx --version
```

### Issue: Project not recognized
**Check** that `project.json` exists in the project directory and is valid JSON.

## Benefits of Nx

1. **Monorepo Management**: Unified tooling across all projects
2. **Intelligent Caching**: 10-50% faster builds
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Automatic understanding of project dependencies
4. **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple tasks concurrently
5. **Code Generation**: Nx plugins can generate boilerplate
6. **Team Scaling**: Enforces consistent patterns across teams
