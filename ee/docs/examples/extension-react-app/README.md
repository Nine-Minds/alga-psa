# Example React Extension App

Scaffold for a React + TS extension UI that runs in an iframe and communicates with the host using `@alga/extension-iframe-sdk`.

Steps:
- Install deps and build the SDK locally or alias it in your bundler.
- Use the IframeBridge to handshake with the host and receive theme/auth.
