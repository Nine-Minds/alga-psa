# Workflow Fixture Harness — Scratchpad

## 2026-01-26
- Created plan scratchpad (this file) to track implementation notes, commands, and decisions for the workflow harness + fixtures work.
- F001: Added `tools/workflow-harness/` with initial `run.cjs` entrypoint and `README.md` usage/conventions.
- F002: Implemented CLI arg parsing + validation in `tools/workflow-harness/run.cjs` (supports cookie-file with newline trimming).
- F003: Added fixture discovery + required file validation (`bundle.json`, `test.cjs`).
- F004: Added `tools/workflow-harness/lib/context.cjs` (ctx config, logging, cleanup registration/execution).
- F005: Added `tools/workflow-harness/lib/http.cjs` (fetch wrapper that sets Cookie + x-tenant-id).
- F006: Added `tools/workflow-harness/lib/db.cjs` (read-only Postgres client via `DATABASE_URL` / connection string).
- F007: Added `tools/workflow-harness/lib/workflow.cjs#importWorkflowBundleV1` (wraps `/api/workflow-definitions/import` with `?force=true`).
- F008: Added `tools/workflow-harness/lib/workflow.cjs#exportWorkflowBundleV1` (wraps `/api/workflow-definitions/:id/export`).
- F009: Added `tools/workflow-harness/lib/runs.cjs#waitForRun` (polls `workflow_runs` by workflowId + tenantId after trigger time).
- F010: Added `tools/workflow-harness/lib/runs.cjs#getRunSteps` + `summarizeSteps` (+ `getRunLogs` for artifacts).
- F011: Wired `tools/workflow-harness/run.cjs` to execute one fixture and emit single-line `PASS/FAIL <testId> <durationMs>` with exit codes.
- F012: Added failure artifact writing (`tools/workflow-harness/lib/artifacts.cjs` + harness wiring) capturing error, import summary, workflow export, run/steps/logs when available.
- F013: Added fixture root `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/` with README and conventions.
- F014: Added golden fixture `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-created-hello/` (published workflow, triggers via `/api/workflow/events`, asserts run SUCCEEDED).
- F015: Standardized fixture key convention (`fixture.<folderName>`) and documented always using `--force` imports for reruns.
- F016: Added harness assertion/timeouts (`tools/workflow-harness/lib/expect.cjs`) and exposed via `ctx.expect`; harness enforces a global timeout.
- F017: Enabled `--debug` verbose logging (import summary + workflow id/key + HTTP/DB debug logs).
- F018: Implemented `--json` output (adds a machine-readable JSON line after PASS/FAIL).
- F019: Added fixture scaffolder `tools/workflow-harness/scaffold.cjs` (creates `bundle.json` + `test.cjs` in `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/<name>`).
- F020: Documented fixture naming scheme + category prefixes in `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/README.md`.
- F021: Harness always runs registered cleanup hooks after each fixture (on pass or fail), and records cleanup errors into artifacts.
- F030: Added initial ticket-trigger fixture set:
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-created-triage-comment/` (create ticket via `/api/v1/tickets`, assert workflow adds internal triage comment)
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-priority-changed-audit-comment/` (update priority via `/api/v1/tickets/:id`, assert workflow adds internal audit comment)
  - Updated `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/README.md` to document `WORKFLOW_HARNESS_API_KEY` / `ALGA_API_KEY` for `/api/v1` triggers.
- F031: Added initial project-trigger fixture `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/project-created-kickoff-tasks/` (create project via `/api/v1/projects`, assert workflow creates kickoff project task).
- F032: Added initial billing-trigger fixture set:
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/invoice-generated-review-task/` (submit `INVOICE_GENERATED` event via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow creates a project task and sends an internal notification)
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/payment-recorded-notify/` (submit `PAYMENT_RECORDED` event via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow sends an internal notification)
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/contract-created-onboarding-task/` (submit `CONTRACT_CREATED` event via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow creates a project task, CRM note, and internal notification)
- F033: Added initial email-trigger fixture set:
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/email-inbound-received-ticket-comment/` (create ticket via `/api/v1/tickets`, submit `INBOUND_EMAIL_RECEIVED` event via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow adds internal comment)
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/email-provider-connected-notify/` (submit `EMAIL_PROVIDER_CONNECTED` event via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow sends an internal notification)
- F034: Added initial scheduling-trigger fixture set:
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/appointment-created-assign-notify/` (submit `APPOINTMENT_CREATED` event via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow creates `schedule_entries` row via `scheduling.assign_user` and sends notification; cleanup deletes ticket + schedule entry)
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/schedule-block-created/` (submit `SCHEDULE_BLOCK_CREATED` event via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow creates a project task and sends notification; cleanup deletes project)
- F035: Added initial integration-trigger fixture set:
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/integration-webhook-received-notify/` (submit `INTEGRATION_WEBHOOK_RECEIVED` via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow sends internal notification)
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/integration-sync-failed-notify/` (submit `INTEGRATION_SYNC_FAILED` via `/api/workflow/events`, assert workflow sends internal notification)
- F040: Added initial node-type coverage fixture:
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-created-assign-trycatch/` (covers `control.tryCatch` + error capture, and asserts both notification + comment side effects)
- F041: Added schema-validation fixtures:
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/schema-unknown-schema-ref/` (submitting an event with an unknown `payloadSchemaRef` fails with 400 + schemaRef details)
  - `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/schema-invalid-event-payload/` (submitting an event with invalid payload fails with 400 + Zod issues)

## Tests
- T001: Added Node test `tools/workflow-harness/tests/args-errors.test.cjs` validating the CLI errors clearly when `--test` is omitted.
- T002: Added Node test coverage for missing `bundle.json` fixture file (fails before DB/HTTP work).
- T003: Added Node test coverage for missing `test.cjs` fixture file (fails before DB/HTTP work).
- T004: Added stubbed runner test `tools/workflow-harness/tests/runner-stubbed.test.cjs` validating `--force` is passed to import and ctx exposes workflow id/key.
- T005: Added stubbed runner test ensuring thrown errors are surfaced and `failure.*` artifacts include stack trace.
- T006: Added stubbed runner test ensuring wait timeouts include diagnostics (`err.details`) and are captured into failure artifacts.
- T007: Added stubbed runner test ensuring successful runs capture `run` + `steps` into the result state for summaries/JSON output.
- T008: Added stubbed runner test for PASS/FAIL line format and exit code via exported `runCliOnceForTests`.
- T009: Added cookie-file unit test and extracted `readCookieFromFile` into `tools/workflow-harness/lib/cookie.cjs` (trims whitespace/newlines).
- T010: Added stubbed runner test that asserts `--debug` emits verbose logs (import summary + workflow id/key).
- T011: Added stubbed runner test verifying cleanup hooks run on both success and failure.
- T020: Added stubbed harness execution test for `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-created-hello` to validate bundle import, event submission call, and run success path without requiring a live server/DB.
- T100: Added stubbed harness execution test for `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-created-triage-comment` validating `/api/v1/tickets` trigger calls include `x-api-key`, and cleanup issues a DELETE.
- T101: Added `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-created-auto-assign-by-priority` + stubbed harness execution test. Workflow reads ticket `attributes.fixture_priority` via `tickets.find` for deterministic branching and assigns to `attributes.fixture_assignee_user_id`, then adds an internal comment with the assignee id.
- T102: Added `ee/test-data/workflow-harness/ticket-created-vip-notify` + stubbed harness execution test. Workflow reads ticket `attributes.fixture_is_vip` via `tickets.find` and sends an in-app notification to `attributes.fixture_notify_user_id` when VIP.
