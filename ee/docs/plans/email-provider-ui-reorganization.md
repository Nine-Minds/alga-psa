# Email Provider Configuration UI Reorganization

## Introduction / Overview

This document outlines the plan to reorganize the inbound email configuration user interface to better reflect the system constraints and improve user experience. 

**Current Problem**: The existing UI uses a tabbed interface that doesn't clearly communicate that only one email provider (Google OR Microsoft) can be configured per tenant, and that these providers are mutually exclusive.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement a card-based selection interface that clearly presents the choice between Google and Microsoft email providers, with intuitive flows for setup and management.

**Key Constraints**:
- Only one inbound provider can be configured per tenant
- Providers are mutually exclusive (Google OR Microsoft, not both)
- Only one provider of each type can be configured per tenant
- Once configured, the provider stays active until explicitly removed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

#### New Component: `EmailProviderSelector.tsx`
```typescript
interface EmailProviderSelectorProps {
  onProviderSelected: (providerType: 'google' | 'microsoft') => void;
  onCancel?: () => void;
}
```

**Responsibilities**:
- Display two prominent cards for Google and Microsoft
- Handle provider selection and communicate back to parent
- Provide clear visual distinction between providers
- Include appropriate branding and iconography

#### Modified Component: `EmailProviderConfiguration.tsx`
**New State Variables**:
- `showProviderSelector: boolean` - Controls selector visibility
- `setupProviderType: 'google' | 'microsoft' | null` - Tracks active setup
- `isSetupMode: boolean` - Indicates if in provider setup flow

**Rendering Logic**:
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for rendering logic
if (providers.length === 0 && !isSetupMode) {
  return <EmailProviderSelector />
}
if (isSetupMode) {
  return <ProviderForm type={setupProviderType} />
}
if (providers.length > 0) {
  return <EmailProviderList />
}
```

### UI/UX Specifications

#### Provider Selector Cards
- **Layout**: Side-by-side grid layout (`grid-cols-2`)
- **Card Size**: ~300px width with responsive scaling
- **Spacing**: Proper gap between cards, centered layout
- **Icons**: 
  - Google: `Mail` icon with Google blue (#4285f4)
  - Microsoft: `Mail` icon with Microsoft blue (#0078d4)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with provider name, description, and CTA
- **Interactions**: Hover effects, focus states, click handling
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

#### Component IDs (following standards)
- `email-provider-selector` - Container
- `google-provider-selector-card` - Google card
- `microsoft-provider-selector-card` - Microsoft card
- `setup-google-provider-button` - Google setup button
- `setup-microsoft-provider-button` - Microsoft setup button

---

## Component Specifications

### EmailProviderSelector Component

#### Visual Design
- Two large, prominent cards displayed side-by-side
- Each card contains:
  - Provider icon (Mail icon with brand colors)
  - Provider name ("Gmail" / "Microsoft 365")
  - Brief description of capabilities
  - "Set up [Provider]" button
- Cards should have subtle shadows and border styling
- Hover states with slight elevation change
- Responsive design that stacks on mobile

#### Interaction Design
- Cards are clickable in their entirety
- Buttons provide primary interaction method
- Clear visual feedback on hover/focus
- Smooth transitions for state changes

#### Technical Requirements
- Built using existing UI components (Card, Button, etc.)
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follows existing component patterns
- Integrates with current styling system
- Accessible keyboard navigation

## User Flow Documentation

### New User Flow (No Providers Configured)
1. **Initial State**: User navigates to Email Configuration
2. **Provider Selection**: Presented with Google/Microsoft selector cards
3. **Provider Choice**: User clicks desired provider card
4. **Setup Mode**: System enters setup mode for selected provider
5. **Form Display**: Provider-specific setup form is shown
6. **Setup Completion**: User completes configuration
7. **Management Mode**: System shows provider management interface
8. **Future Visits**: Selector is bypassed, management interface shown directly

### Existing Provider Flow (Provider Already Configured)
1. **Initial State**: User navigates to Email Configuration
2. **Management Mode**: Provider management interface shown immediately
3. **Edit Option**: User can edit existing provider (current behavior)
4. **Delete Option**: User can delete provider
5. **Return to Selection**: After deletion, system returns to provider selector

### Edit Provider Flow
1. **Management Mode**: User sees configured provider
2. **Edit Action**: User clicks edit button
3. **Form Display**: Provider-specific edit form shown
4. **Cancel Action**: Returns to management mode (not selector)
5. **Save Action**: Updates provider, returns to management mode

## Scratchpad / Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation Analysis
- Main component: `EmailProviderConfiguration.tsx`
- Uses tabs for provider selection within "Add Provider" card
- State management includes: `providers[]`, `showAddForm`, `selectedProvider`, `selectedProviderType`
- Provider forms: `MicrosoftProviderForm`, `GmailProviderForm` (both use module aliasing)
- Provider list: `EmailProviderList.tsx` handles current provider display

### Key Findings
- Current tab-based approach doesn't emphasize mutual exclusivity
- Forms already have proper cancel functionality
- State management is already in place for provider type selection
- Module aliasing system supports both CE and EE forms

### Implementation Considerations
- Need to preserve existing functionality for editing providers
- Must maintain Enterprise vs Community Edition form switching
- Should preserve all existing callbacks and event handlers
- Need to ensure responsive design works across devices

### Questions to Address During Implementation
- [ ] How should the selector handle loading states?
- [ ] Should there be any provider-specific messaging in the selector?
- [ ] How should error states be handled in the new flow?
- [ ] Should the selector include any preview of what each provider offers?

### Testing Scenarios to Verify
- [ ] New tenant with no providers configured
- [ ] Tenant with Google provider configured
- [ ] Tenant with Microsoft provider configured  
- [ ] Provider setup cancellation flows
- [ ] Provider editing and deletion flows
- [ ] Responsive behavior on mobile devices
- [ ] Accessibility with screen readers
- [ ] Enterprise vs Community Edition differences

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Minimize re-renders when switching between modes
- [ ] Lazy load provider forms if not immediately needed
- [ ] Optimize image/icon loading for provider cards
- [ ] Consider caching provider status to reduce API calls

### Future Enhancements (Post-Implementation)
- [ ] Add provider capability comparisons in selector
- [ ] Include setup difficulty indicators
- [ ] Add provider-specific tips or requirements
- [ ] Consider animated transitions between states
