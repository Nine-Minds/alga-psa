# Storage API Validation & Quotas

> **Status:** Archived. Schema governance and quota enforcement are now managed by the shared tenant storage service.

Consult the [Alga Storage Service documentation](../../../docs/storage-system.md) for up-to-date limits, schema workflows, and validation error formats. Extension manifests no longer register schemas or quotas; coordinate directly with the platform team when you need namespace-specific policies.
