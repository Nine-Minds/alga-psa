# Alga PSA Extension Security & Signing

This document outlines the security architecture for the Alga PSA Extension System, with a focus on extension signing, verification, and trust management.

## Extension Signing Overview

Extension signing provides three critical security properties:

1. **Authenticity** - Verifies that extensions come from claimed developers
2. **Integrity** - Ensures extensions haven't been tampered with
3. **Non-repudiation** - Developers can't deny authorship of signed extensions

## Certificate Infrastructure

### Certificate Hierarchy

The Alga PSA Extension System uses a three-level certificate hierarchy:

1. **Root Certificate Authority (CA)** - Managed by Alga PSA
2. **Intermediate CAs** - Used for different developer categories (official, partner, community)
3. **Developer Certificates** - Issued to individual developers or organizations

```
Alga PSA Root CA
├── Official Extensions CA
│   ├── Developer Certificate (Alga PSA)
│   └── Developer Certificate (Alga PSA Partners)
├── Partner Extensions CA
│   ├── Developer Certificate (Partner 1)
│   ├── Developer Certificate (Partner 2)
│   └── ...
└── Community Extensions CA
    ├── Developer Certificate (Developer 1)
    ├── Developer Certificate (Developer 2)
    └── ...
```

### Certificate Requirements

Developer certificates must include:

- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Developer name and email
- Organization (if applicable)
- Public key (RSA 2048-bit minimum or ECC P-256 minimum)
- Valid from/to dates
- Certificate usage limitations
- Issuing CA signature

## Extension Package Signing

### Signing Process

1. **Package Preparation**:
   - Developer builds extension package (code, assets, manifest)
   - A manifest hash is calculated for all included files
   - Package metadata is prepared including version, timestamp, etc.

2. **Signature Generation**:
   - Developer signs the package manifest hash with their private key
   - Signature, certificate ID, and algorithm are added to the package metadata

3. **Package Finalization**:
   - Final `.algaext` package is created including:
     - All extension files
     - Manifest with signature information
     - Package metadata

### Signing Tools

Developers can sign extensions using:

1. **CLI Tool**:
   ```bash
   alga-extension sign --cert=/path/to/cert.pem --key=/path/to/key.pem my-extension.algaext
   ```

2. **Developer Portal**:
   - Web interface for uploading and signing extensions
   - Automatic certificate management
   - Verification before submission to marketplace

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - GitHub Actions integration
   - Azure DevOps integration
   - Jenkins pipeline support

## Signature Verification

### Verification Process

When an extension is installed or updated, Alga PSA verifies the signature:

1. **Certificate Chain Validation**:
   - Verify the developer certificate against trusted CAs
   - Check certificate validity period
   - Check certificate revocation status

2. **Signature Verification**:
   - Extract the signature and claimed certificate ID
   - Calculate the package manifest hash
   - Verify the signature against the hash using the certificate's public key

3. **Trust Determination**:
   - Based on certificate chain and organizational policies
   - Apply administrator-configured trust settings

### Trust Levels

Extensions are assigned one of these trust levels:

| Trust Level | Description | Visual Indicator |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Trusted** | Official extensions by Alga PSA or certified partners | Green shield badge |
| **Verified** | Extensions signed by known developers with valid certificates | Blue checkmark badge |
| **Limited Trust** | Valid signature but developer not in trusted list | Yellow caution badge |
| **Untrusted** | Invalid signature or unsigned extension | Red warning badge |

### Certificate Revocation

Certificates can be revoked in cases of:
- Private key compromise
- Developer policy violations
- Malicious extension detection

Revocation methods include:
- Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
- Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
- Revocation status is checked during installation and periodically

## Manifest Signature Format

```json
{
  "id": "com.example.my-extension",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "RSA-SHA256",
    "value": "base64-encoded-signature-data",
    "certificateId": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-01T12:00:00Z",
    "hashAlgorithm": "SHA256",
    "signedAttributes": [
      "id", "name", "version", "main", "permissions", 
      "extensionPoints", "fileHashes"
    ],
    "fileHashes": {
      "dist/index.js": "sha256-hash-value",
      "dist/components/Widget.js": "sha256-hash-value",
      "...": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Administrator Controls

### Trust Settings

Administrators can configure trust settings in the Alga PSA admin interface:

1. **Minimum Trust Level**:
   - Set the minimum required trust level for extensions
   - Options: Trusted Only, Verified or Above, Any Signed, All (including unsigned)

2. **Certificate Management**:
   - View and manage trusted certificates
   - Add custom trusted certificates
   - View certificate details and chain

3. **Extension Approval**:
   - Manual approval workflow for extensions below the minimum trust level
   - Approve specific versions or all versions from a developer
   - Set approval expiration

### Organizational Policies

Enterprise customers can implement specific policies:

1. **Allowlisting**:
   - Only specifically approved extensions can be installed
   - Approve by extension ID, developer, or certificate

2. **Certificate Restrictions**:
   - Restrict to specific certificate authorities
   - Require specific certificate attributes

3. **Additional Verification**:
   - Integration with internal security scanning
   - Custom verification steps before approval

## Developer Certificate Acquisition

### Certificate Issuance Process

1. **Developer Registration**:
   - Create account on Alga PSA Developer Portal
   - Verify email address and identity
   - Accept developer terms and conditions

2. **Certificate Request**:
   - Generate certificate signing request (CSR)
   - Submit CSR through Developer Portal
   - Provide additional verification if required

3. **Certificate Issuance**:
   - Certificate issued after approval
   - Certificate delivered securely to developer
   - Public certificate published to certificate directory

### Certificate Management

Developers can manage their certificates through the Developer Portal:

1. **Certificate Renewal**:
   - Renew before expiration (certificates valid for 1 year)
   - Renewal process similar to initial issuance
   - Seamless transition between old and new certificates

2. **Certificate Revocation**:
   - Self-service revocation for compromise
   - Revoke and replace option
   - Emergency contact for urgent revocation

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Private Key Protection**:
   - Store private keys in secure, isolated storage
   - Use hardware security modules (HSMs) when possible
   - Never share private keys

2. **Secure Development**:
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Minimize permissions requested
   - Use allowlists instead of denylists

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Avoid dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### For Administrators

1. **Trust Configuration**:
   - Set appropriate minimum trust level
   - Review extensions before approval
   - Regularly audit installed extensions

2. **User Education**:
   - Train users on extension risks
   - Establish reporting process for suspicious extensions
   - Document approved extensions

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable extension activity logging
