# Storage API Rollout Plan

> **Status:** Archived. The phased rollout for the extension storage API is complete and the platform now relies on the centralized Alga Storage Service.

Future changes to storage provisioning, migrations, or tenant onboarding are coordinated through the shared platform processes documented in [docs/storage-system.md](../../../docs/storage-system.md). Use those procedures when planning migrations or communicating changes; this legacy rollout plan is retained only for historical reference.
