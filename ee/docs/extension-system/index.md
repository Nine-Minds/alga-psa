## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Extension System (Current Focus)
- Core registry with basic lifecycle management
- Simple extension manifest validation
- Local extension loading (no marketplace)
- Basic extension administration UI

### Phase 2: Core UI Extensions (Current Focus)
- Navigation menu items
- Dashboard widgets
- Custom standalone pages

### Phase 3: Basic API Extensions (Current Focus)
- Simple custom API endpoints
- Basic permission model
- Manual approval process

### Phase 4: Future Expansion
- Entity page extensions
- Workflow customization
- Data model extensions
- Advanced security features
- Extension marketplace
- Advanced developer tools

## Next Steps (80/20 Approach)

1. Create database migration for basic extension tables
2. Implement minimal extension registry service
3. Develop basic manifest validation using Zod
4. Build simple extension lifecycle management
5. Create UI extension slots for navigation and dashboard
6. Develop custom page support
7. Implement basic API endpoint extension support
