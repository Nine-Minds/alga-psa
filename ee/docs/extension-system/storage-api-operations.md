# Storage API Operational Readiness

> **Status:** Archived. Operational ownership moved to the tenant-wide Alga Storage Service.

All runbooks, shard validation steps, and restore procedures now live with the shared platform documentation. Refer to the [Alga Storage Service guide](../../../docs/storage-system.md) and infrastructure playbooks for current operational checklists. Extension-specific tables (`ext_storage_*`) have been decommissioned; remove any lingering automation that targets them directly.
