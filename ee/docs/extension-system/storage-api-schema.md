# Storage API Citus Schema Design

> **Status:** Archived. The extension-bound schema (`ext_storage_*`) has been replaced during the migration to the tenant storage service.

Current schema definitions, distribution strategy, and quota accounting tables are maintained centrally with the storage platform. See [docs/storage-system.md](../../../docs/storage-system.md) for the canonical data model and reach out to the database engineering team before making schema adjustments.
