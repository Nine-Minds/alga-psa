- [ ] 1.8 RBAC Integration

## Current Task

Working on: Implementing the Extension Administration UI
- ✅ Database schema with tenant isolation
- ✅ Extension registry service
- ✅ Manifest validation
- ✅ Storage service with Redis caching
- ✅ UI extension framework with error boundaries
- ✅ Tab extensions
- ✅ Navigation extensions
- ✅ Custom page extensions
- ✅ Documentation and examples
- ⏳ Extension Administration UI

## Notes & Findings

* The project already has a stub directory structure at `/ee/server/src/lib/extensions/`
* Alga PSA uses a UI reflection system we need to integrate with (via `ReflectionContainer`)
* Tab navigation in Alga uses URL query parameters (e.g., `/msp/billing?tab=overview`)

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
Created the following tables for the extension system:
1. `extensions` - Core table for extension metadata and manifest
2. `extension_permissions` - Tracks permissions required by extensions
3. `extension_files` - Stores information about extension files
4. `extension_storage` - Key-value storage for extension data with tenant isolation
5. `extension_settings` - Stores extension configuration per tenant

Added RLS policies to ensure proper tenant isolation across all extension tables.

### Design Decisions
1. Using tenant-specific row-level security for all extension-related tables
2. Using UUID primary keys for all tables to match Alga's existing pattern
3. Storing manifests as JSONB for flexible schema and querying capabilities
4. Implementing a circuit breaker pattern for Redis operations to handle outages gracefully
5. Storing extension-specific data in namespaced keys for better organization and isolation
6. Using Zod for manifest validation to provide detailed validation errors
7. Integrating with Alga's UI reflection system for consistent component tracking
8. Using Alga's URL query parameter pattern for tab activation and navigation
9. Providing extension slots with proper permission checking
10. Implementing error boundaries to prevent extension failures from crashing the application

## Testing Plan

Key areas to test in the extension system:

1. **Database Schema**
   - Verify table creation with proper constraints
   - Test tenant isolation with RLS policies
   - Confirm foreign key relationships work correctly

2. **Extension Registry**
   - Test registering, enabling, and disabling extensions
   - Verify version and dependency checking
   - Test tenant isolation in the registry

3. **Storage Service**
   - Test CRUD operations with proper tenant isolation
   - Verify Redis caching with circuit breaker pattern
   - Test storage quotas and TTL functionality
   - Verify namespace isolation

4. **UI Framework**
   - Test component loading and rendering
   - Verify error boundaries contain extension failures
   - Test performance metrics collection

5. **Tab Extensions**
   - Test integration with existing pages
   - Verify URL-based tab activation
   - Test permission-based filtering of tabs
   - Ensure proper UI reflection system integration

## Summary of Implementation

We have implemented the core components of the Alga PSA client extension system following the 80/20 approach, focusing on the features that deliver the most value. The implemented components include:

1. **Database Schema**: Created tables for extensions, permissions, files, storage, and settings with proper tenant isolation using RLS policies.

2. **Extension Registry**: Implemented a registry service to manage extension lifecycle, including registration, enabling, disabling, and dependency checking.

3. **Manifest Validation**: Created Zod schemas for validating extension manifests, permissions, and extension points with detailed error reporting.

4. **Storage Service**: Implemented a tenant-isolated storage service with Redis caching and circuit breaker pattern for resilience.

5. **UI Extension Framework**: Created components for extension slots, error boundaries, and dynamic component loading, integrated with Alga's UI reflection system.

6. **Tab Extensions**: Implemented tab extensions that allow third-party extensions to add tabs to existing pages like Billing, Tickets, etc. Integrated with Alga's URL-based tab switching pattern.

7. **Navigation Extensions**: Implemented navigation extensions that allow third-party extensions to add items to Alga's sidebar navigation. Includes support for collapsed state with tooltips.

8. **Custom Page Extensions**: Implemented custom page extensions with dynamic routes using Next.js App Router, allowing extensions to create entirely new pages with their own routing.

The implementation follows Alga PSA patterns and integrates with the existing codebase, ensuring a consistent user experience and developer experience. All extension points are properly integrated with Alga's UI reflection system for automation and testing support.
