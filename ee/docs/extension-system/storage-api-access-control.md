# Storage API Access Control

> **Status:** Archived. The extension-bound storage API has been replaced by the tenant-wide Alga Storage Service.

Access control, authentication, and authorization guidance now lives in the [Alga Storage Service documentation](../../../docs/storage-system.md). Storage capabilities are no longer declared in extension manifestsâ€”tenants provision storage keys directly and share them with any runtime (extensions, workflows, or external integrations) that requires access.

If you maintain legacy code that still depends on runner-issued storage credentials, migrate to the tenant storage key flow described in the official documentation and remove any extension-level capability configuration.
  - Write-heavy ops default to 60 ops/min burst 180.
  - Read ops default to 200 ops/min burst 400.
- Gateway and Runner share the same limiter backend to keep counters consistent.

## Deployment & Feature Flags

- Capability checks hidden behind `storageApiEnabled` feature flag per environment.
- Initial rollout restricts to allowlist of extension ids until GA.
- Rollback path disables flag, preventing new storage calls while leaving data intact.
- Runner integration requires `STORAGE_API_BASE_URL` and `RUNNER_STORAGE_API_TOKEN` environment variables; requests must present the token via `x-runner-auth`.

## Developer Documentation Updates

- Update `ee/docs/extension-system/overview.md` to mention the storage API and capability requirements.
- Extend the SDK README with usage examples referencing capability flags.
- Provide manifest snippet:
  ```jsonc
  {
    "capabilities": {
      "alga.storage": {
        "namespaces": [
          { "name": "settings", "schemaReference": "./schemas/settings.json", "access": ["read", "write"] }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
