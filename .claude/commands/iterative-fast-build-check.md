Please iteratively work to get the build working. Use subtasks to run the build, verify the compilation, fix and errors and repeat until it is successful. Allow for build times as long as 5 minutes without timing out. Use npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck as a quick build for the purposes of this check.

Skip unit test files!
