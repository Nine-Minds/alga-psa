Please analyze the current UI state from the automation server and help me understand what's happening on the screen.

Follow these steps:

1. **Dump the current UI state** by running the UI state dump tool:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/robertisaacs/alga-psa/tools/ai-automation && node dump-ui-state.js
   ```

2. **Analyze the output** and provide insights about:
   - What page/screen is currently active (based on component structure)
   - What interactive elements are available (buttons, forms, dialogs, etc.)
   - Any dialogs or modals that are currently open
   - The overall component hierarchy and navigation state
   - Any issues or anomalies in the UI state

3. **Optional analysis** (if arguments provided): $ARGUMENTS

4. **Provide actionable insights** such as:
   - What automation actions are currently possible
   - Which components can be interacted with
   - Suggestions for next steps in testing or automation
   - Any debugging recommendations if issues are found

**Context**: This command is used for debugging the UI automation and reflection system. The tool connects to the automation server on port 4000 to get real-time UI state data from the React application.

**Note**: Make sure the automation server is running before using this command (`cd /Users/robertisaacs/alga-psa/tools/ai-automation && npm start`).
