# Tenant Cleanup Tool for Alga PSA
# 
# Usage:
#   ./cleanup-tenant.nu list                          # List all tenants
#   ./cleanup-tenant.nu inspect <tenant-id>           # Inspect tenant data
#   ./cleanup-tenant.nu cleanup <tenant-id>           # Cleanup tenant (dry-run)
#   ./cleanup-tenant.nu cleanup <tenant-id> --execute # Actually delete data
#
# Options:
#   --environment <local|production>   Environment to use (default: local)
#   --execute                          Actually delete data (without this, it's a dry run)
#   --preserve-tenant                  Keep the tenant record itself
#   --force                             Skip confirmation prompts
