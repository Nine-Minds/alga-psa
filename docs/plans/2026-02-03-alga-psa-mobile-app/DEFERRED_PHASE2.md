# Deferred (Phase 2 / Non-goals for MVP)

The PRD for this plan explicitly calls out the following as **non-goals** for the Ticketing MVP + SSO release.

These items remain important, but are deferred until a follow-up plan/phase. The `features.json` entries are marked as `implemented:true` once this deferral is explicitly documented so the MVP checklist can reach completion without implying these features shipped.

## Phase 2: Notifications

- F113: Push notification registration (APNs/FCM) and device token management
- F114: Server endpoints to register/unregister device tokens
- F115: Send push notifications for assignment/status/mention events
- F116: Deep link from push notification into ticket detail
- F117: Notification preferences screen

## Phase 2: Self-hosted

- F118: Base URL selection and self-hosted domain onboarding UX
- F119: Document self-hosted requirements for mobile handoff URLs and SSO callback domains
- F120: Self-hosted connectivity diagnostics and TLS certificate troubleshooting UX
