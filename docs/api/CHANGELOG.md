# API Changelog

Notable, externally visible changes to the Alga PSA REST API, newest first.

## 2026-10-27 — Asset maintenance schedule request contract corrected

**Affected endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/assets/{id}/maintenance`, `PUT /api/v1/assets/maintenance/{scheduleId}`

Both endpoints previously advertised request fields that do not exist on `asset_maintenance_schedules`, so every create failed with a `500` database error. The request contract now matches the UI and database columns. See [asset-maintenance-schedules.md](asset-maintenance-schedules.md) for the full contract.

**Changes:**

- `POST` now requires `schedule_name`, `maintenance_type`, `frequency`, `frequency_interval`, `schedule_config`, and `next_maintenance`. `description` and `is_active` are optional.
- Field renames: `schedule_type` → `maintenance_type`, `notes` → `description`, `start_date` → `next_maintenance` (stored as supplied, not advanced by the interval). `end_date` and `assigned_to` are removed; `created_by` is taken from the authenticated caller.
- `maintenance_type` gains `corrective`.
- Legacy and unknown fields now return `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` instead of being dropped. On `PUT`, response-only fields (`schedule_id`, `asset_id`, `tenant`, `created_by`, `created_by_name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `last_maintenance`, `archived_at`) are accepted and ignored, so a row read from `GET` can be sent back as-is.
- `frequency: "custom"` now has recurrence logic. It requires a rule at `schedule_config.recurrence` (`unit` of `days`/`weeks`/`months`/`years`, multiplied by `frequency_interval`, with optional `weekdays` for weeks or `days_of_month` for months). The rule is validated on `POST`, and on `PUT` against the merged row; a `custom` schedule without a rule returns `400`. Recording maintenance against a `custom` schedule previously failed with a validation error.
- `next_maintenance` must be an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp with a `Z` suffix. Values with a numeric offset (for example `-04:00`) return `400`.
- `POST` creates the schedule, its upcoming notification, and the initial open occurrence (when active) in one transaction. `PUT` changes to `next_maintenance` move the open occurrence and unsent notifications; disabling cancels the open occurrence and re-enabling an unarchived schedule opens one.
- Response objects now expose `schedule_name`, `description`, `maintenance_type`, `created_by`, `archived_at`, and `created_by_name`; `start_date`, `end_date`, `notes`, `assigned_to`, and `assigned_user` are gone.

**Migration note:** Update clients and MCP tools to send the corrected field names. Existing `custom` schedules that have no `schedule_config.recurrence` still cannot be completed; add a rule with `PUT` to make them recur.

## 2026-10-27 — Time sheet create/update fixed; act-on-behalf enforced on create

**Affected endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/time-sheets`, `PUT /api/v1/time-sheets/{id}`

**Changes:**

- API keys/users without act-on-behalf rights can no longer create time sheets for other users. `POST` with a `user_id` other than the caller's now returns `403` unless the caller has `time_sheet:approve` and either `time_sheet:read_all` or manages that user. Creating a time sheet for yourself is unchanged.
- `POST` and `PUT` no longer fail with a database error: they wrote `created_at`/`updated_at` columns that `time_sheets` does not have.

## 2026-10-17 — Time entries resolve contract lines; delete reverses billing usage

**Affected endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/time-entries`, `PUT /api/v1/time-entries/{id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/time-entries/{id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/time-entries/bulk`

Time entries written through the REST API now use the same write path as the UI: billable entries are linked to a contract line, the origin of the link is recorded, and bucket usage is drawn.

**Changes:**

- `POST` and `PUT` accept new optional body fields `contract_line_id` (uuid) and `tax_rate_id` (uuid, nullable). When `contract_line_id` is omitted and exactly one contract line is eligible, it is chosen automatically; with no eligible line the entry is saved unresolved.
- `POST` and `PUT` can now return `400` when the line cannot be chosen:
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "…",
      "details": {
        "reason": "contract_line_ambiguous" | "contract_line_not_eligible",
        "eligible_contract_lines": [{ "contract_line_id": "…", "contract_line_name": "…", "contract_line_type": "…", "contract_id": "…", "contract_name": "…", "has_bucket": true }]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Retry with `contract_line_id` set to one of the listed candidates.
- `DELETE /api/v1/time-entries/{id}` and `DELETE /api/v1/time-entries/bulk` now reverse the bucket usage draw and the hour-block burn made by the deleted entry (same as deleting in the UI). Previously they left the usage in place, so bucket totals overstated what was still linked.

**Migration note:** Bucket usage left stale by earlier API deletes is not corrected retroactively.

## 2026-10-03 — Service category `display_order` now persisted on create/update

**Affected endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/categories/service`, `PUT /api/v1/categories/service/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/categories/service`, `GET /api/v1/categories/service/{id}`

Previously, creating a service category through the REST API always set `display_order` to `0`, regardless of the value supplied. Categories created entirely through the API therefore piled up with the same order value and sorted unpredictably.

**Changes:**

- `POST /api/v1/categories/service` now accepts an optional `display_order` integer (>= 0). When omitted, the new category is appended with `max(display_order) + 1` across the tenant — matching the behavior of the UI. An explicit `0` is honored as provided.
- `PUT /api/v1/categories/service/{id}` now persists `display_order` when supplied. A PUT that omits `display_order` leaves the existing value unchanged.
- `display_order` is present on all read responses for service categories (`GET` collection and single).

**Migration note:** Categories created via the API before this fix all have `display_order = 0`. Their relative order is unaffected by this change — the fix only applies to new creates and explicit updates. If you want to establish a deliberate order for existing categories, PUT each one with the intended `display_order` value.

## 2026-09-18 — Ticket bundle status propagation

**Affected endpoints:** `PUT /api/v1/tickets/{id}`, `PUT /api/v1/tickets/{id}/status`

- Both endpoints now accept an optional boolean `propagateToChildren`.
- `PUT /api/v1/tickets/{id}` and `PUT /api/v1/tickets/{id}/status` now propagate a status change to child tickets when the target is a `sync_updates` bundle master. Previously the REST path performed no propagation; this is a behaviour change for API callers that update such a master's status.
- A status change that crosses the open/closed boundary on a `sync_updates` master with at least one affected child returns `409 CONFLICT` when `propagateToChildren` is omitted. The error body is:
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "CONFLICT",
      "message": "…",
      "details": {
        "reason": "bundle_propagation_confirmation_required",
        "crossesBoundary": "close" | "reopen" | null,
        "affectedChildren": [{ "ticket_id": "…", "ticket_number": "…", "title": "…", "is_closed": false }],
        "unaffectedChildren": [{ "ticket_id": "…", "ticket_number": "…", "title": "…", "is_closed": true, "reason": "already_closed" | "independently_closed" | "already_open" }]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Retry with `propagateToChildren: true` to close/reopen the affected children with the master, or `false` to change the master only.
- Reopening a master only reopens children that the master's close closed. Children closed independently (before bundling, or added closed) stay closed.
- No backfill: existing bundles have no propagation records, so the first master reopen after this deploy reopens no children via propagation. This is the safe direction — nothing is reopened unexpectedly.
