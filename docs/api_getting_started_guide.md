# API Getting Started Guide

This guide will help you get started with using the Alga PSA APIs. It's designed for API consumers who want to integrate with our system.

## Note: This document describes pre-release APIs. Many features are not yet available, and APIs are subject to change.

## 1. Introduction

The Alga PSA APIs provide programmatic access to our Professional Services Automation platform. You can use these APIs to:
- Manage tenants and their configurations
- Access and update business data
- Automate workflows
- Integrate with your existing systems

Our APIs follow REST principles and use JSON for request/response payloads. All API access is over HTTPS, and all data is sent and received as JSON.

> üìù **Note:** The Alga PSA hosted environment is available at `api.algapsa.com`. If you are running an on-premise installation, replace this with your configured domain.

## 2. Obtaining API Access

### Prerequisites
- An active Alga PSA account
- Appropriate permissions to generate API keys

### Generating an API Key
API keys can be generated through our web interface:

1. Log in to your Alga PSA account
2. Click on your profile in the top-right corner
3. Navigate to your User Profile settings
4. Scroll down to the "API Keys" section
5. Click "Generate New API Key"
6. Provide a description (e.g., "Integration Testing")
7. Optionally set an expiration date
8. Save the generated API key securely - it will only be shown once and cannot be retrieved later

## 3. Authentication

All API requests must include your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```http
GET /api/v1/endpoint
Host: api.algapsa.com
x-api-key: your-api-key-here
```

Example using cURL:
```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key-here" https://api.algapsa.com/api/v1/endpoint
```

Example using JavaScript/Node.js:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.algapsa.com/api/v1/endpoint', {
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': 'your-api-key-here'
  }
});
```

Example using Python:
```python
import requests

headers = {
    'x-api-key': 'your-api-key-here'
}
response = requests.get('https://api.algapsa.com/api/v1/endpoint', headers=headers)
```

## 4. Making Your First API Call

Let's verify your API access by making a simple request:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key-here" https://api.algapsa.com/api/health
```

Expected successful response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## 5. Understanding Responses

### Success Responses
Successful responses will have a 2xx status code and return JSON data:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Example Resource"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses
Error responses will have a 4xx or 5xx status code and include error details:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "code": "AUTH001"
  }
}
```

Common HTTP Status Codes:
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid or missing API key)
- 403: Forbidden (valid API key but insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found
- 429: Too Many Requests
- 500: Internal Server Error

## 6. Available APIs

### Community Edition APIs
Our Community Edition includes core functionality APIs for:
- Asset Management
- Billing
- Companies/Clients
- Contacts
- Documents
- Projects
- Support Ticketing
- Time Management

### Enterprise Edition APIs
Enterprise Edition includes additional APIs for:
- Tenant Provisioning
- Advanced Workflows
- Custom Integrations

For detailed API documentation, refer to:
- [API Overview](api_overview.md)
- [Tenant Provisioning API](tenant_provisioning_api.md)

## 7. Best Practices

### Security
- Keep your API keys secure and never share them
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Use separate API keys for different integrations
- Set appropriate expiration dates for API keys

### Performance
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Handle rate limits gracefully
- Use pagination for large data sets

### Integration Tips
- Start with a test environment
- Implement proper logging
- Set up monitoring for API usage
- Keep track of API versions and changes

## 8. Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and system stability:
- Implement exponential backoff when encountering rate limits
- Watch for 429 (Too Many Requests) status codes
- Consider implementing request queuing for high-volume operations

Example handling of rate limits:
```javascript
async function makeRequest(url, apiKey, retries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, {
        headers: { 'x-api-key': apiKey }
      });
      
      if (response.status === 429) {
        // Wait for 2^i seconds before retrying
        await new Promise(resolve => 
          setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, i) * 1000)
        );
        continue;
      }
      
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === retries - 1) throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
