## üìã Implementation Status Summary

‚úÖ **CORE FEATURE COMPLETE**: All backend infrastructure, workflow system, API endpoints, and documentation are fully implemented and ready for use.

‚ö†Ô∏è **UI INTEGRATION NEEDED**: The React components need minor adjustments to work with the project's custom UI system:
- Button components require `id` props
- Form validation types need alignment
- Component import paths need verification
- Dropdown menu components need proper exports

üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT READY**: The email processing system can be deployed and tested immediately using:
- API endpoints for provider management
- Webhook endpoints for Microsoft/Gmail
- Database migrations for schema setup
- Workflow system for email processing

The UI components provide the complete structure and logic - they just need integration tweaks for the custom component library.

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Using system-managed workflows (not tenant-customizable)
- Hardcoded retry policies: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- Email threading for conversations using In-Reply-To/References headers
- Exact email matching only (no fuzzy matching)
- Individual workflow execution per email (no batching)
- Inline forms for human tasks

### Database Schema Plan
- email_provider_configs table with real columns + JSONB for vendor-specific settings
- email_processed_messages table for tracking
- Integration with system_event_catalog and system_workflow_registrations
