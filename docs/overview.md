## Architectural Overview of the Open-Source MSP PSA

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the open-source MSP PSA (Professional Services Automation) application. It covers the system's key components, their interactions, and the underlying technologies used, along with relevant file paths.

**I. Core Modules and File Paths:**

* **Asset Management:** Manages asset lifecycle. Key files located under `server/src/models/asset.ts`, `server/src/lib/models/assetRelationship.ts`, and components under `server/src/components/assets`.
* **Billing:** Handles complex billing scenarios. Core logic resides in `server/src/lib/billing/billingEngine.ts`, with related components in `server/src/components/billing-dashboard`. Invoice templates are managed under `server/src/components/billing-dashboard/InvoiceTemplates.tsx`.
* **Companies/Clients:** Manages client information. See `server/src/lib/models/company.tsx` and components under `server/src/components/companies`.
* **Contacts:** Manages contact information. See `server/src/lib/models/contact.tsx` and components under `server/src/components/contacts`.
* **Documents:** Provides a centralized document repository. Core logic is in `server/src/models/document.tsx` and `server/src/lib/models/document.tsx`, with components located under `server/src/components/documents`.
* **Interactions:** Tracks client interactions. See `server/src/lib/models/interactions.ts` and components under `server/src/components/interactions`.
* **Projects:** Manages projects and tasks. Key files include `server/src/lib/models/project.ts` and components under `server/src/components/projects`.
* **Reporting and Analytics:**  Reporting components are located under `server/src/components/Reports.tsx` and `server/src/components/billing-dashboard/Reports.tsx`.
* **Scheduling:** Manages appointments and technician dispatch. See `server/src/lib/models/scheduleEntry.ts` and components under `server/src/components/time-management/ScheduleCalendar.tsx`.
* **Security:** Implements security measures. RBAC and ABAC logic is under `server/src/lib/auth/`. Authentication is handled in `server/src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
* **Settings:**  Configuration settings. See components under `server/src/components/settings`. User management is under `server/src/components/settings/general/`.
* **Support Ticketing:** Manages support tickets. See `server/src/lib/models/ticket.tsx` and components under `server/src/components/tickets`.
* **Time Management:** Tracks time entries and manages timesheets. Key files include `server/src/lib/models/timeEntry.interfaces.ts` and components under `server/src/components/time-management`.

**II. Technical Architecture and File Paths:**

* **Frontend:** Next.js application located in `server/src/pages` and `server/src/components`.
* **Backend:** Node.js server with API routes in `server/src/pages/api`. Server actions are defined within the `server/src/lib/actions` directory.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL database schema defined in the `server/migrations` folder. Knex.js configurations are in `server/knexfile.cjs` and `server/src/lib/db/knexfile.tsx`.
* **Caching:**  `server/src/lib/cache` directory contains the caching implementation.
* **Real-time Collaboration:** Hocuspocus integration setup in `server/src/lib/createHocuspocusProvider.tsx`.
* **Authentication:** NextAuth.js configuration in `server/src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts`.
* **API:** API routes are located in `server/src/pages/api`.
* **Testing:** Tests are located in the `server/src/test` directory.
* **Deployment:** Dockerfile for the server is at `server/Dockerfile`. Kubernetes configurations are in the `helm` directory.

**III. Key Design Considerations:**

* **Multi-Tenancy:** Enforced through database schema and row-level security.
* **Modularity:** Achieved through the organization of modules in the `server/src/components` and `server/src/lib` directories.
* **Scalability:** Addressed through caching (`server/src/lib/cache`) and database optimization strategies.
* **Security:** Implemented through RBAC/ABAC (`server/src/lib/auth`) and secure authentication (`server/src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts`).
* **Extensibility:**  Facilitated by well-defined API endpoints (`server/src/pages/api`) and a modular codebase.

**IV. Future Enhancements:**

* **AI/ML Integration:** Explore opportunities for AI/ML capabilities for tasks like predictive maintenance and automated ticket routing.
* **Expanded Integrations:** Develop API for third-party integrations and enhance client portal features.
* **Mobile Access:**  Develop mobile applications for both technicians and clients.
* **Advanced Reporting and Analytics:** Implement more sophisticated reporting and analytics features for data-driven decision making.
