## Architectural Overview of the Open-Source Alga PSA

> üìù **Note:** The Alga PSA hosted environment is available at `api.algapsa.com`. If you are running an on-premise installation, replace this with your configured domain.

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the open-source MSP PSA (Professional Services Automation) application. It covers the system's key components, their interactions, and the underlying technologies used, along with relevant file paths.

**I. Core Modules and File Paths:**

* **Asset Management:** Manages asset lifecycle. Key files located under `server/src/models/asset.ts`, `server/src/lib/models/assetRelationship.ts`, and components under `server/src/components/assets`.

* **Billing:** The Billing module handles complex billing scenarios, including fixed-price services, time-based billing, usage-based billing, bucket of hours/retainer plans, discounts, promotions, multi-currency, tax handling, bundling, plan bundles, refunds, and adjustments. It integrates with other modules like Projects, Time Management, and Documents to produce and store invoices.

  * Key Features:
    - Billing Plans: Assign multiple billing plans to a single client (company).
    - Plan Bundles: Create named collections of billing plans that can be managed as a single entity.
    - Automated Invoice Generation: Automatically generate invoices for time- or usage-based charges.
    - Manual Invoicing: Allows ad-hoc or on-demand invoice creation and updates. Useful for one-off or custom charges that do not originate from usage/time entries.
    - Tax Calculation: Supports flexible tax rules via a dedicated TaxService that looks up tax rates from the database.
    - Transactions: Each invoice generation, payment, or adjustment is recorded in the transactions table for auditing and financial tracking.

  * **Workflows Backend:** Workflow-related services, actions, and utilities are located in `ee/server/src/services/flow/`. Server actions specific to workflows are in `ee/server/src/lib/actions/workflow.ts`.

### Upcoming Runtime Change: Moving from the built-in Next.js server to an Express.js custom server

Historically the application has been deployed by relying on the server that ships with Next.js.  While this works well for most SaaS workloads, there are two concrete limitations we keep running into:

1. The built-in **Edge / Stand-alone runtime** used by Next.js middleware makes it difficult to
   ‚Ä¢  access long-lived Node primitives (database pools, Redis clients, etc.)
   ‚Ä¢  mount 3rd-party express/connect style middleware (Sentry, rate-limits, custom request-logging)
2. The stock server offers very little configurability at the HTTP-layer (timeouts, keep-alive tuning, connection-handling, pre-warmed pools, etc.) which we need in bare-metal / Kubernetes clusters.

Because SEO is *not* a concern for the product (login-gated SaaS) we do **not** depend on the Vercel edge-network or ISR.  That opens the door for us to run the application with the full Node runtime by embedding Next.js inside an **Express** server ‚Äì a path explicitly documented by the framework team (see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/custom-server).

Key goals of the migration

‚Ä¢ Retain every developer-facing Next.js feature:  
  ‚Äì App routes (`/app/(.)`) and API routes (`/api/...`)  
  ‚Äì React Server Components + Server Actions  
  ‚Äì Hot-reloading / Fast-refresh in development  
‚Ä¢ Eliminate the edge-runtime from our middleware, so we can share ordinary `node-postgres`, `ioredis`, etc. connections.
‚Ä¢ Allow us to insert *traditional* express middleware ‚Äì e.g. a single Sentry request handler rather than the current duplicated `initSentry()` helper in every route.
‚Ä¢ Provide a single place to fine-tune HTTP server behaviour (timeouts, compression, request-body limits, etc.).

Proposed high-level design

1. Create `server/index.ts` that:
   ‚Ä¢ Calls `next({ dev: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' })` to initialise the Next.js compiler/handler.  
   ‚Ä¢ Spins up an `express()` instance and mounts:
     ‚Äì Health-check & readiness probes at `/healthz` and `/readyz` (needed by k8s).  
     ‚Äì Logging, Sentry, tracing and rate-limit middleware.  
     ‚Äì The Next.js request handler *last*, via `app.get('*', nextHandler)` ‚Äì this keeps parity with Next‚Äôs routing precedence.
2. Swap the `npm run start` script in `package.json` to `NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js` after the build step.
3. Update the Docker image to expose `server/index.js` instead of `next start`.
4. Keep the current `next dev` workflow untouched for local development ‚Äì the express server only runs in `production` mode.

Potential pitfalls & mitigations

‚Ä¢ Authentication callbacks (e.g. NextAuth.js) must be wrapped correctly so cookies are still parsed by their built-in utilities. *Mitigation*: run their API routes *through* the Next handler; do **not** move them to raw express.
‚Ä¢ `headers()` / `cookies()` helpers inside RSC still work because they ultimately read from the incoming `RequestLike` ‚Äì which Next constructs for us. Our express server will forward the raw `req`/`res` objects untouched to the Next handler, so nothing breaks.
‚Ä¢ If we ever decide to re-enable ISR or the App Router cache we must ensure the underlying `fs` access is still available in the container. This is already the case today.

Timeline

‚Ä¢ Phase 1 ‚Äì prototype branch with side-by-side express server & CI checks (1-2 days).  
‚Ä¢ Phase 2 ‚Äì Staging deploy behind feature flag (1 week).  
‚Ä¢ Phase 3 ‚Äì Production cut-over & post-mortem (1 day).

No code has been merged yet ‚Äì this section serves as an architectural note so all contributors understand *why* we are switching away from the default runtime and what constraints we must preserve.

* **Enterprise Edition (`ee`) Folder:**
  * The `ee` folder contains the server code for the Enterprise Edition of the application.
  * It mirrors the base server directory structure and includes its own migrations that are overlaid on top of the base server migrations.
  * EE-specific database changes should be made in the migrations within the `ee` folder.
  * **File Paths:**
    * Protobuf definitions: `ee/server/protos/`.
    * Generated Protobuf code: `ee/server/src/generated/`.

* **Database:**
  * PostgreSQL database schema defined in the `server/migrations` folder.
  * Knex.js configurations are in `server/knexfile.cjs` and `server/src/lib/db/knexfile.tsx`.
  * EE-specific migrations are located in `ee/server/migrations/`.
  * Local EE migrations (dev workstations): use the temp-dir overlay runner documented in `docs/migrations/local-ee-migrations.md`.

* **Caching:** `server/src/lib/cache` directory contains the caching implementation.

* **Real-time Collaboration:** Hocuspocus integration setup in `server/src/lib/createHocuspocusProvider.tsx`.

* **Authentication:** NextAuth.js configuration with multi-portal support:
  * Main configuration: `server/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts`
  * Portal pages: `/auth/msp/*` for MSP users, `/auth/client-portal/*` for client users
  * Shared components: `/auth/password-reset/*`, `/auth/check-email`, `/auth/verify-email`

* **API:** API routes are located in `server/src/pages/api`.

* **Testing:** Tests are located in the `server/src/test` directory.

* **Deployment:** Dockerfile for the server is at `server/Dockerfile`. Kubernetes configurations are in the `helm` directory.

* **Enterprise vs Community Edition Implementation:**
  * The application uses a module aliasing system to handle features that differ between Enterprise Edition (EE) and Community Edition (CE):
    ```typescript
    // Configuration in next.config.mjs
    config.resolve.alias['@ee'] = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EDITION === 'enterprise'
      ? path.join(__dirname, '../ee/server/src')
      : path.join(__dirname, 'src/empty')
    ```
  
  * **Empty Implementations Pattern:**
    * Located in `server/src/empty/` directory
    * Mirrors the EE directory structure
    * Provides CE-appropriate fallbacks for enterprise features
    * Example structure:
      ```
      server/src/empty/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ flow/
      ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DnDFlow.tsx      # Empty workflow editor component
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chatStreamService.ts # Empty chat service
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ storage/
              ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/
                  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ S3StorageProvider.ts # Empty storage provider
      ```
    
  * **Implementation Strategies:**
    * UI Components: Display "Enterprise Feature" messages with upgrade information
    * Services: Return appropriate HTTP responses (e.g., 403 Forbidden) with upgrade messages
    * Storage Providers: Throw clear enterprise-only errors
    * Example:
      ```typescript
      // CE implementation of an enterprise feature
      export class ChatStreamService {
        static async handleChatStream(req: NextRequest) {
          return new Response(
            JSON.stringify({ 
              error: 'Chat streaming is only available in Enterprise Edition' 
            }), 
            { status: 403 }
          );
        }
      }
      ```

  * **Type Safety:**
    * TypeScript paths configuration ensures proper type checking:
      ```json
      {
        "compilerOptions": {
          "paths": {
            "@ee/*": [
              "../ee/server/src/*",
              "./src/empty/*"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    * Empty implementations maintain the same interfaces as their EE counterparts
    * This ensures type safety across both editions

**III. Key Design Considerations:**

* **Multi-Tenancy:** Enforced through database schema and row-level security.

* **Modularity:**
  * Achieved through the organization of modules in the `server/src/components` and `server/src/lib` directories.
  * The addition of the **Workflows** module enhances the system's modularity, allowing users to define custom automation workflows.

* **Scalability:** Addressed through caching (`server/src/lib/cache`) and database optimization strategies.

* **Security:**
  * Implemented through RBAC/ABAC (`server/src/lib/auth`) and secure authentication (`server/src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options.ts`).
  * The workflows feature incorporates security measures to ensure that only authorized users can create or modify workflows.

  RBAC Roles (Client Portal)
  - Required roles: `User` and `Admin` in the client portal (`roles.msp = false`, `roles.client = true`).
  - Migrations create/normalize these roles; application code assumes they exist.
  - No legacy fallback: code no longer falls back to roles named "Client"/"Client_Admin". Missing roles cause explicit errors to surface misconfigurations.

* **Extensibility:**
  * Facilitated by well-defined API endpoints (`server/src/pages/api`) and a modular codebase.
  * The workflows module allows for the extension of system capabilities through custom automation, enabling integrations with external systems and services.

**IV. Future Enhancements:**

* **AI/ML Integration:**
  * With the foundation laid by the workflows module, explore opportunities for integrating AI/ML capabilities.
  * Potential applications include predictive maintenance, automated ticket routing, and intelligent decision-making within workflows.

* **Expanded Integrations:**
  * Develop APIs for third-party integrations and enhance client portal features.
  * Leverage the workflows module to streamline integrations with external systems.

* **Mobile Access:** Develop mobile applications for both technicians and clients.

* **Advanced Reporting and Analytics:** Implement more sophisticated reporting and analytics features for data-driven decision-making.
