# Settings Reference Data Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the reference data management features available in the Settings area of the application. Reference data includes system-wide configurations like priorities, statuses, channels, and categories that are used throughout the ticketing and project management systems.

## Accessing Reference Data Settings

### Navigation

1. Click on **Settings** in the main navigation
2. Navigate to either:
   - **General** → **Ticketing Settings** (for most reference data)
   - **Billing** → **Settings** (for service-related reference data)

## Ticketing Settings

### Tabs Overview

The Ticketing Settings page contains multiple tabs:

- **Priorities** - Urgency levels for tickets
- **Statuses** - Workflow states for tickets  
- **Channels** - Communication channels
- **Categories** - Ticket categorization
- **Service Types** - Types of billable services
- **Interaction Types** - Customer communication methods

### Common Features

All reference data types share these features:

1. **Add New** - Create custom entries
2. **Edit** - Modify existing entries
3. **Delete** - Remove unused entries (with protection for in-use items)
4. **Import from Standard Types** - Import pre-defined system entries
5. **Pagination** - Navigate through large datasets
6. **Ordering** - Control display sequence

## Managing Channels

Channels are organizational containers that group related ticket categories, similar to boards or high-level groupings (e.g., General Support, Technical Issues, Administration, Security & Compliance).

### Features

- **Active/Inactive Toggle** - Enable or disable channels
- **Default Channel** - Set the default channel for client portal ticket submissions
- **Description** - Add context for each organizational grouping
- **Display Order** - Control the sequence in channel lists

### Import Process

1. Click **Import from Standard Channels**
2. Select channel groupings to import using checkboxes
3. Review Active/Default status (shown as switches)
4. Click **Import Selected**

### Best Practices

- Keep at least one channel active
- Set a sensible default channel for client portal
- Use clear, descriptive names that reflect organizational areas
- Consider how categories will be grouped under each channel

## Managing Categories

Categories provide hierarchical organization for tickets and projects.

### Unique Features

- **Parent-Child Relationships** - Create category hierarchies
- **Channel Assignment** - Categories belong to specific channels
- **Hierarchical Display** - Subcategories shown indented under parents

### Creating Categories

#### Parent Categories
1. Click **Add Category**
2. Enter category name
3. Select a channel (required)
4. Set display order
5. Click **Create**

#### Subcategories
1. Click **Add Category**
2. Enter category name
3. Select a parent category from dropdown
4. Display order is auto-calculated
5. Channel is inherited from parent
6. Click **Create**

### Editing Categories

- **Parent Categories**: Can change name, order, and channel
- **Subcategories**: Can change name and order only
- **Channel Changes**: Changing a parent's channel affects all subcategories

### Import Process

1. Click **Import from Standard Categories**
2. **Select Target Channel** (required)
3. Select categories to import
   - Parent categories import with their subcategories
   - Maintain hierarchical structure
4. Click **Import Selected**

### Channel Filtering

Use the channel dropdown to filter categories:
- "All Channels" shows everything
- Individual channels show only their categories
- Hierarchy is maintained in filtered views

## Managing Service Categories

Located in **Billing** → **Settings**, service categories organize your service catalog.

### Features

- Group related services
- Control billing presentation
- Support for descriptions
- Custom ordering

### Usage

Service categories are used when:
- Creating service catalog items
- Generating invoices
- Running billing reports

## Import Conflict Resolution

When importing items that conflict with existing data:

### Name Conflicts

When an item with the same name exists:
- **Skip this item** - Don't import the conflicting item
- **Import with new name** - Enter a different name

### Order Conflicts

When the display order is taken:
- System suggests next available order
- Automatically resolved on import

### Resolution Tips

- Review existing data before importing
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Plan display ordering strategy

## Best Practices

### Organization

1. **Consistent Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Avoid abbreviations
   - Consider sorting implications

2. **Logical Ordering**
   - Most common items first
   - Group related items
   - Leave gaps for future additions

3. **Channel Strategy** (Categories)
   - Assign categories to appropriate channels
   - Don't overcomplicate the hierarchy
   - Maximum 2-3 levels deep recommended

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Review**
   - Remove unused items
   - Update descriptions
   - Verify channel assignments

2. **Before Importing**
   - Check what already exists
   - Plan the target structure
   - Consider impact on existing tickets

3. **Testing Changes**
   - Test in a non-production environment first
   - Verify ticket creation still works
   - Check reporting impacts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't delete a category**
- Check if tickets are using it
- Remove associations first

**Import button not working**
- Verify you have appropriate permissions
- Check browser console for errors

**Categories not showing**
- Check channel filter setting
- Verify categories have correct channel

**Subcategories appearing at wrong level**
- Verify parent category relationship
- Check display order values

### Tips

- Use browser refresh if data seems stale
- Check for validation errors in forms
- Review server response in network tab

## Advanced Features

### Bulk Operations

While not available in UI, administrators can:
- Use database scripts for bulk updates
- Export/import via API (if available)
- Modify multiple items via direct database access

### Integration Points

Reference data is used by:
- Ticket creation forms
- Reporting systems
- Client portal
- API endpoints
- Workflow automation

Changes to reference data immediately affect these systems.
